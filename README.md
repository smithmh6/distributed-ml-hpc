# MOE-Py: Multivariate Optical Element Design Toolbox
## Introduction
Multivariate Optical Elements(MOEs) are specialized, thin-film, optical filters designed to be sensitive to specific analytes. Using Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and Multivariate Statistics, MOEs can predict concentrations or be utilized for classification problems in point detection systems or imaging systems. This toolbox automates the design of an MOE and provides tools for analyzing the performance of an MOE.
